## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for static export (`output: 'export'`) to be hosted on any static hosting service (e.g., Apache/Nginx, GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).

To deploy:
1.  Create a `.env.local` file with the following credentials (ask the administrator for values):
    ```env
    DEPLOY_HOST=your-ftp-host.com
    DEPLOY_USER=your-ftp-username
    DEPLOY_PASS=your-ftp-password
    DEPLOY_REMOTE_DIR=/public_html/your-site-dir
    ```
2.  Run the deployment script:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This will build the project and upload the `out` directory to the configured FTP server.

## 🧪 Verification

To verify the installation:
1.  Run `npm run build` to check for build errors.
2.  Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues.

## 📄 content.json Structure

The app uses a structured JSON file for content. Each domain contains a set of questions with the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "domain_1_q1",
  "question": "Question text here...",
  "options": {
    "A": "Option A text",
    "B": "Option B text",
    "C": "Option C text",
    "D": "Option D text"
  },
  "correctAnswer": "A",
  "explanation": "Deep dive explanation..."
}
```

*Note: The `options` are shuffled at runtime for the user, but stored keyed A-D in the source.*
